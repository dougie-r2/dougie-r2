### Hi, I'm delphinH 👋



- I’m interested in problem solving with probabilistic programming.
- Since I believe Julia will be the most powerful language, I am studying Julia language.

:computer: I love coding in  **R**, **Julia** and **Python**. Some library I use :
* Tidyverse(dplyr, ggplot2, stringr, purrr)
* Turing.jl
* Flux.jl
* Pluto.jl
* tensorflow (probability)
* keras
* Numpy/Pandas/seaborn/plotly

Interested in Fianance:chart:, Aquaecosystem:dolphin::tropical_fish: 

My hobby : :film_projector:  🍞
